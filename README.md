# Digyvira

A simple tool to build your own family tree

## Run in development mode

We used pnpm to manage dependencies, although it's only needed for running unit tests.:

```bash
# to install dev dependencies
pnpm install

# to run in development mode
pnpm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production build of the app you can run:

```bash
pnpm run build
```
